or home page or the like: the place to find all public information
about your project.
This may be the same link as the "how to access a running version"
page.
The 
 <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos333/demo17.html">
 link on the course web page</a> should be the same.

<P> <a href="demo.pdf">your demo slides, etc., if you used them</a>.
Please submit these as PDF or as a web page, not Powerpoint.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with <i>exactly</i> the
specified names, all lower case</b>.  
They must not require logging into some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  
We need to have all submissions in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
